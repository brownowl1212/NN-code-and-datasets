These Python files comprise neural network code tailored for the multi-dataset neural network, capable of simultaneous training on multiple datasets.

The "NN_multi_dataset_hyperparameter_tuner.py" file facilitates hyperparameter tuning to identify the most suitable parameters for the task at hand.

Meanwhile, the "NN_multi_dataset.py" file contains the implementation of the optimised neural network. This code serves the dual purpose of training and testing the neural network across the CAS, CALCE, and Oxford battery degradation datasets.
